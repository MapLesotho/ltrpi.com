The Lesotho Town and Regional Planning Institute is Lesotho’s planning body for spatial, sustainable and inclusive planning in the Country. 

It was established on the 19th of February 2015 after discussions with planners throughout the country and with assistance from both the _Irish Planning Institute_and the Royal Town Planning Institute Ireland _in association with the help and financial support of_ Fingal County Council, _Ireland in conjunction with the **Fingal / Lesotho Partnership**._

" _Encouraging, assisting and supporting our members throughout their professional careers is what we do. We will make sure out members stand out and become great professionals in the art of town planning._"

•	Access for our members to CPD (Continuous Professional Development) ensuring that they have the most up to date knowledge and information regarding town and regional planning in both Lesotho and internationally. 
•	An Institute who purpose is to advance the science and art of planning (including Town and Regional country and spatial planning) for the benefit of not only the townplaners but also the public.

Our campaigning activity covers a wide range of issues, helping to raise the profile of the profession in both Lesotho and internationally within Africa, to  generate awareness of the invaluable contribution planners make to building sustainable communities in Lesotho and helping to drive economic wealth also.
